These are config files and commands to set up a system the way I like it.

```sh
$ ip [-e] # Returns current (Wi-fi) IP address or current external IP address.
```

```sh
$ cb # Returns clipboard content.
$ ls |Â cb # Sets clipboard content.
```
  
```sh
$ rds # Authorize on Amazon RDS.
$ ec2 # Authorize on Amazon EC2.
```

## Installation

```sh
$ git clone git://github.com/haihappen/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ cd ~/.dotfiles && rake
```

You can remove them easily too!

```sh
$ cd ~/.dotfiles && rake uninstall
$ cd ~ && rm -rf ~/.dotfiles
```

### Installing the LaunchAgents

```sh
$ mkdir ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ cp /Your/Download/Directory/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
$ launchctl load /Users/mario/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dropbox.personal.plist # Run for each!
```

### Uninstalling

```sh
launchctl unload /Users/mario/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.dropbox.personal.plist# Run for each!
```
